=========

API docs from source code comments and plain text into LaTeX markup and output as PDF.

This project includes scripts and stylesheets that create API docs from source code comments and plain text. The scripts convert those 2 sources of content into a monolithic file that contains LaTeX markup. A PDF engine can then be used to render the LaTeX markup as a PDF file.
